# UBC Micromet


Our research group explores the physical, biological and chemical processes that control trace gas, water and energy fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. We investigate how land‑atmosphere exchanges of greenhouse gas fluxes respond to a changing climate and disturbances, and how we can modify land management practices for climate change adaptation and mitigation. We combine micrometeorological measurements with remote sensing and modelling to understand soil-plant-atmosphere interactions across a range of spatial and temporal scales. We collaborate with a broad group of researchers and institutions to help inform and advance climate policy.


## Our Github

This Github Organization hosts code for flux processing, readme docs for our lab, and various other bits of information like data maybe? 

## Territorial and Cultural Acknowledgement

UBC Micromet is based out of the University of British Columbia, which traditional, ancestral, and unceded  on xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) teritory.  Our field sites are located in the the Statl̕əẃ (Sto:lo) River Delta (aka the Fraser River Delta).  This area encompass the traditional territories of a number of First Nations, including the: xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, Stó:lō, sc̓əwaθenaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsawwassen), kwantlen, Semiahmoo, Stz'uminus, Á,LEṈENEȻ ȽTE (W̱SÁNEĆ), and sq̓əc̓iy̓aɁɬ təməxʷ (Katzie) people.
