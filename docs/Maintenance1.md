#  Maintenance Procedures
{: .no_toc }

This section covers general procedures for doing maintenance and calibration at our flux sites.  Under normal operating conditions, maintenance trips should occur every 4-6 weeks for each site.  **At least two** lab members are required on each trip.  Whenever possible BB1 & BB2 should always be visited on the same trip.  DSM & RBM can also be visited in one trip to save fuel.
