# Git vs Github ... whats the difference?

Git and Github are incredibly powerful and useful tools.  Unfortunately, they're also pretty confusing and there is a steep learning curve.

**Git** is a version control system.  It lets you manage and track of code, keeping a history of changes each time you make a "commit".

**GitHub** is a cloud-based service that hosts Git repositories.  It makes it easier for to share code and work with collaborate.  

## Whats a Repository?

A repository (or repo) is just a collection of code, files, data, etc. that are being tracked by Git.

## Common Git Commands

**init**: Creates an empty repository

**commit**: Tells git to "save" a repository in its current state.

**clone:**: Tells git to "copy" a repository from a remote location (i.e. a github URL) to a local directory on you computer

**pull:**: Tells git to "download" any changes from a remote repository (i.e. a github URL you previously cloned) to your local copy

**push**: Tells git to "upload" any changes from a local (your computer) copy of a repository to a remote repository (i.e. a github URL you previously cloned)
